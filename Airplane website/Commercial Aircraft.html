        <h1 id="Conclusion" >Boeing vs Airbus</h1>
       <p> The biggest difference between a Boeing and an Airbus cockpit is that the Boeing uses a conventional yoke, and Airbus uses a side stick. According to Airbus, the side stick makes it easier to fly the aircraft because, with armrests correctly set, only very fine wrist movements are required to maneuver the aircraft.</p>
